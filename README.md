# Type1-TSK-Fuzzy-Logic-System
In this project, we have designed a type one tsk fuzzy neural network to solve the regression problem.
- In this model, We performed the rule learning step using FCM clustering.
- We performed the step of learning the weights of the last layer based on the pseudo-inverse method.
- The input function of the network is the Mackey Glass functions.
